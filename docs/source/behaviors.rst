Overview
========

You can build functionality by combining and connecting blocks within a Behavior.

A behavior is like a program:

* You control the execution flow by connecting Signal pins.
* You control the data flow by connecting Data pins.

Code Blocks
===========

Code Blocks are created by you and are unique to your project. 

You have complete control over the inputs, outputs, and functionality (code) within each block.

You can access the engine through an `API <http://api>`_ and perform a wide range of functionality.
