Browser Support
===============

The run-time and editor run in any web-browser.

However, we are focusing our testing efforts on Chrome |chrome| so we recommend it for best experience.

Technology
==========

Spider is based on modern web technologies:

* Written in `Typescript <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`_
* Uses `WebGL <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API>`_ for graphics rendering
* Uses `Cannon.js <http://www.cannonjs.org/>`_ for simulating physics
* Game logic can be entirely developed in **Javascript**

Target Platforms
================

Web is and will always be the primarily supported platform by the Spider Engine.

It also runs on PC. 

Support for MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android is coming soon.

We plan to license the run-time under an open source license, along with the first official release after beta.

This will be our first open source project. If you have experience in the open source scene, we are definitly interested in hearing from you! `Contact Us <https://franticsoftware.com/#shapely_home_contact-4>`_
