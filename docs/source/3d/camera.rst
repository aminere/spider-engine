Camera

Cameras render what they see to the screen or to a render target.

Render Target
-------------

Render Targets are textures that can be used as camera targets.

By default, cameras render everything they see to the screen, unless they have a Render Target.

They can be referenced by materials, exactly like regular textures.

To create a Render Target, click on the Create Button |create_button| in the :ref:`Assets View <assets-view>` and select **Render Target**.
